# Class Notes

low level, something that's part of the hardware.

high level, something that's part of Java.

all interfaces are inherently public.

constants ("final") are all UPPERCASE

push, pop, top...(add, remove, view the top)

List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>();

List is the interface while ArrayList is the class

`<Integer>` is a generic.

`<T>` is a generic generic. it can be anything.
